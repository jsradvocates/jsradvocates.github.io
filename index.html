                        Lawyers apply the law to specific cases. They investigate the facts and the evidence by
                        conferring with their clients and reviewing documents, and they prepare and file the pleadings
                        in court. At the trial, they introduce evidence, interrogate witnesses, and argue questions of
                        law and fact. If they do not win the case, they may seek a new trial or relief in an appellate
                        court.
                </p>
                <img class="imgs-responsive" src="media/2.jpg">
                <p class="welcome-paragraph">In many instances, lawyers can bring about the settlement of a case without
                        trial through negotiation, reconciliation, and compromise. In addition, the law gives
                        individuals the power to arrange and determine their legal rights in many matters and in various
                        ways, as through wills, contracts, or corporate bylaws, and lawyers aid in many of these
                        arrangements. Since the 20th century a rapidly developing field of work for lawyers has been the
                        representation of clients before administrative committees and courts and before legislative
                        committees.
                </p>
                <img class="imgs-responsive" src="media/3.jpg">
                <p class="welcome-paragraph">Lawyers have several loyalties in their work, including loyalties to their
                        clients, to the administration of justice, to the community, to their associates in practice,
                        and to themselves. When these loyalties conflict, the standards of the profession are intended
                        to effect a reconciliation.
