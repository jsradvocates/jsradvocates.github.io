                <p class="welcome-paragraph">Lawyers have several loyalties in their work, including loyalties to their
                        clients, to the administration of justice, to the community, to their associates in practice,
                        and to themselves. When these loyalties conflict, the standards of the profession are intended
                        to effect a reconciliation.
                </p>

                        lawyer, one trained and licensed to prepare, manage, and either prosecute or defend a court
                        action as an agent for another and who also gives advice on legal matters that may or may not
                        require court action.

                        Lawyers apply the law to specific cases. They investigate the facts and the evidence by
                        conferring with their clients and reviewing documents, and they prepare and file the pleadings
                        in court. At the trial, they introduce evidence, interrogate witnesses, and argue questions of
                        law and fact. If they do not win the case, they may seek a new trial or relief in an appellate
                        court.
